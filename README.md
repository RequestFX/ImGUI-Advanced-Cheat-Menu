# ImGUI-Advanced-Cheat-Menu

> An ImGui Menu preset that is somewhat useable.
* SFML is used for backend.
* This Menu does not modify ImGui. New elements are added in imgui_custom.hpp (Hotkey Button)

## Features
* Decent Menu to work with
* Custom Hotkey Button (broken rn)
* Console Window for Debugging
* Font Loaded from Memory (Poppins and Fontawesome v.5 for Icons)
* Overlay for Active Modules Loaded (very improvable) 

## Features to add
* Configs Loading and Saving
* Search Feature
* Title for Panels
* Animations?
* Custom Items

## Known Issues to Fix
* ImGui/Hotkey Button doesnt work correctly (Due to SFML backend, TESTED dx12 which doesn't have this issue)
